Threads in C programming are part of a process that allows for multiple flows of control or tasks to be executed concurrently within the same program.

# 1. What is a Thread?

- **Definition**: A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be performed in an OS. In most respects, a thread is similar to a traditional process, except that threads within the same process share memory and other resources.
- **Comparison with Processes**: Threads are often called lightweight processes. They share the same memory space and resources, while processes have separate memory.
