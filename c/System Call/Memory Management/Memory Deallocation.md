[free]: After allocating memory with `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`, it's essential to release that memory using the `free` function to prevent memory leaks.
    
**Dangling Pointers:** Be cautious of using pointers to memory that has been deallocated. Accessing deallocated memory leads to undefined behavior.

```c
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Use the allocated memory free(ptr); // Deallocate the memory when done
```

It's crucial to free allocated memory to prevent memory leaks. Failing to free memory results in a memory leak, where memory is consumed by the program but not released for reuse.
